    "text": "Selection bias and IPW methods\nConfounding bias and selection bias are together the most prevalent hurdles to the validity and generalizability of causal inference results. In general, both arise from uncontrolled extraneous flows of statistical information between treatment and outcome in the analysis. Their precise characterization in the Structural Causal Models framework (SCM), and potential corrections, differ in nature:\n\nConfounding bias emerges from open backdoor paths between treatment and outcome in the directed acyclic graph (DAG) that represents the set of assumptions on the system’s causal mechanisms. In experimental settings, (conditional) randomization of treatment assignment provides a practical solution to the problem. In observational studies, the do-calculus, developed by Judea Pearl (Pearl 2009), constitute a complete and formal set of graphical rules to test the identifiability of the target causal parameters.\nSelection bias emerges from the preferential exclusion of units from the sample under analysis. It implies conditioning on a collider (or a descendant of a virtual collider), which opens backdoor paths between treatment and outcome. Besides, distributions learnt from the biased samples might not generalize to the whole population. Selection bias cannot be removed via randomization, which makes it a concern for experimental settings as well. There exist extensions of the do-calculus to deal with selection bias in some cases. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) methods are more frequently used in applied work.\n\n\nQuestion: selection, mediation and IPW methods\nInverse probability weighting (IPW) methods provide nonparametric statistical techniques to perform inference with biased data. In their basic presentation, they approximate the interventional mean of the outcome using a weighted average over the selected sample. Let:\n\n\\((y_i)_{i=1}^N\\) be a sample of outcomes for the selected (non-excluded) units\n\\(w_i\\) be the relative inverse probability of selection, \\(w_i=p/p_i\\), where \\(p\\) is the population-level probability of selection, and \\(p_i\\) is the probability of selection for unit \\(i\\)\n\\(v_i(a)\\) be the inverse probability of assignment of treatment \\(a\\) for unit \\(i\\).\n\nThe idea of IPW methods is motivated by the desired asymptotic result (*):\n\\[\n\\lim_{N\\rightarrow\\infty} N^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\mathbb{I}[A_i=a] v_i(a)\\cdot w_i\\cdot y_i\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{E}[Y\\mid do(A=a)]\n\\]\nThe derived finite-sample estimator is consistent if \\(v_i(a)\\cdot w_i\\) is; this is, if the probability of selection and the probability of treatment assignment are jointly correctly specified.\nThe question that motivates the present analysis is:\n\nIs the IPW estimator still consistent if the probability of selection depends on a mediator of the causal effect?\n\nTo answer this question let us analyse the results of an IPW-based approach on a simple simulation with a randomized treatment assignment under two cases:\n\nThe selection mechanism does not depend on a mediator\nThe selection mechanism does depend on a mediator\n\n\n\nSimple simulation setting\nLet us consider the SCM given by the following DAG and set of structural equations:\n\nThe DAG:\n\n\nCode\n# DAG visualization\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dagitty)\nlibrary(ggdag)\n\ndagify(\n  M ~ A,\n  S ~ A + M + L,\n  Y ~ A + M + L\n) %>% tidy_dagitty(layout = \"nicely\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) +\n  geom_dag_point(color='white',size=0.5) +\n  geom_dag_edges() +\n  geom_dag_text(color='black') +\n  theme_dag()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructural equations:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}[c]\nL &\\sim\\text{Nor}(0,\\sigma^2_L) & &\\\\\nA &\\sim\\text{Ber}(p) & &\\\\\nM &= \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1A + u_M & u_M &\\sim\\text{Nor}(0,\\sigma^2_M) \\\\\nS &= \\mathbb{I}[\\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1A + \\gamma_2M + \\gamma_3L + u_S > 0] & u_S &\\sim\\text{Nor}(0,\\sigma^2_S) \\\\\nY &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1A + \\beta_2M + \\beta_3L + u_Y & u_Y &\\sim\\text{Nor}(0,\\sigma^2_Y)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nLet us put this SCM as a data-generating process (DGP) in R code:\n\n\nCode\n# Libraries needed\nlibrary(DescTools)\nlibrary(LaplacesDemon)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(modelsummary)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(zeallot)\nlibrary(reshape2)\n\n# Data generating process\ndgp = function(param){\n  \n  #### Parameters\n  c(n,      # Number of samples\n    sdl,    # Stdr. dev. of selection predictor\n    p,      # Treatment assigment probability\n    a0, a1, # Parameters of A->M relation\n    sdm,    # Stdr. dev. of mediator noise\n    g0, g1, # Parameters of A->S relation\n    g2,     # Parameter of M->S relation\n    g3,     # Parameter of L->S relation\n    sds,    # Stdr. dev. of selection noise\n    b0, b1, # Parameters of A->Y relation\n    b2,     # Parameter of M->Y relation\n    b3,     # Parameter of L->Y relation\n    sdy # Stdr. dev. of selection noise\n    ) %<-% param     \n  \n  # Exogenous selection predictor\n  L = rnorm(n=n, mean=0, sd=sdl)\n  \n  # Treatment assigment\n  A = rbinom(n=n, size=1, prob=p)\n  \n  # Mediator\n  noise.M = rnorm(n=n, mean=0, sd=sdm)\n  M = a0 + a1*A + noise.M\n  \n  # Selection mechanism\n  noise.S = rnorm(n=n, mean=0, sd=sds)\n  S = ifelse(g0 + g1*A + g2*M + g3*L + noise.S > 0, 1, 0)\n  \n  # Outcome\n  noise.Y = rnorm(n=n, mean=0, sd=sdy)\n  Y = b0 + b1*A + b2*M + b3*L + noise.Y\n  \n  # true ATE\n  true.ATE = b1 + b2*a1\n  \n  # Data\n  dat = data.frame(L,A,M,S,Y)\n  \n  # Return\n  return(list(dat,true.ATE))\n}"

In other words, the IPW-based estimator is consistent.\n\nMathematical justification of consistency\nWe can prove consistency mathematically for this SCM. However, to avoid measure-theoretic conundrums, let us consider the case for which all variables are discrete. Results are generalizable for mixed discrete-continuous cases with positive distributions (no zero-measure events).\nLet us assume \\(Y\\) has support on \\(\\{y_{(c)}\\}_{c=1}^C\\), and \\(L\\) has support on \\(\\{l_{(k)}\\}_{k=1}^K\\), then:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat{Y}^a &= N^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^N\\frac{\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}(S=1)}{\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}(A=a)\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}(S=1\\mid A=a_i,L=l_i)}\\cdot y_i\\cdot \\mathbb{I}(A_i=a) \\\\\n&=\nN^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^N\\frac{\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}(S=1)}{\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}(A=a\\mid L=l_i)\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}(S=1\\mid A=a,L=l_i)}\\cdot y_i\\cdot\\mathbb{I}(A_i=a,S_i=1)\\\\\n&=\n\\sum_{i=1}^N\n\\frac{\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}(S=1)}{\n\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}(S=1\\mid L=l_i)\n}\\cdot\n\\frac{\ny_i\\cdot\\mathbb{I}(A_i=a,S_i=1)/N}{\n\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}(A=a\\mid L=l_i,S=1)\n}\\\\\n&= \\sum_{i=1}^N\\sum_{k}\\sum_{c}\n\\frac{\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}(S=1)}{\n\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}(S=1\\mid L=l_{(k)})\n}\\cdot\n\\frac{\ny_{i}\\cdot\\mathbb{I}(A_i=a,L_i=l_{(k)},S_i=1)/N}{\n\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}(A=a\\mid L=l_{(k)},S=1)\n}\\\\\n&= \\sum_{k}\\sum_{c}\n\\frac{\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}(S=1)}{\n\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}(S=1\\mid L=l_{(k)})\n}\\cdot\n\\frac{\ny_{(c)}\\cdot\\sum_{i=1}^N\\mathbb{I}(Y_i=y_{(c)},A_i=a,L_i=l_{(k)},S_i=1)/N}{\n\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}(A=a\\mid L=l_{(k)},S=1)\n}\\\\\n&= \\sum_{k}\\sum_{c}\n\\frac{\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}(S=1)}{\n\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}(S=1\\mid L=l_{(k)})\n}\\cdot\n\\frac{\ny_{(c)}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}(Y=y_{(c)},A=a,L=l_{(k)}\\mid S=1)}{\n\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}(A=a\\mid L=l_{(k)},S=1)\n}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAssuming the propensity scores and the probability of selection are both correctly specified, all finite-sample approximations \\(\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}\\) converge in the limit to the true distributions \\(\\mathbb{P}\\). Then:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{plim}_{N\\rightarrow\\infty}\n\\hat{Y}^a\n&=\n\\sum_{k}\\sum_{c}\n\\frac{{\\mathbb{P}}(S=1)}{\n{\\mathbb{P}}(S=1\\mid L=l_{(k)})\n}\\cdot\n\\frac{\ny_{(c)}\\cdot{\\mathbb{P}}(Y=y_{(c)},A=a,L=l_{(k)}\\mid S=1)}{\n{\\mathbb{P}}(A=a\\mid L=l_{(k)},S=1)\n}\\\\\n&=\n\\sum_{k}\\sum_{c}\n\\frac{{\\mathbb{P}}(L=l_{(k)})}{\n{\\mathbb{P}}(L=l_{(k)}\\mid S=1)\n}\\cdot\n\\frac{\ny_{(c)}\\cdot{\\mathbb{P}}(Y=y_{(c)},A=a,L=l_{(k)}\\mid S=1)}{\n{\\mathbb{P}}(A=a\\mid L=l_{(k)},S=1)\n}\\\\\n&=\n\\sum_{k}\\sum_{c}\n{\\mathbb{P}}(L=l_{(k)})\n\\cdot\ny_{(c)}\\cdot{\\mathbb{P}}(Y=y_{(c)}\\mid A=a,L=l_{(k)} S=1)\\\\\n&=\n\\sum_{k}\n{\\mathbb{P}}(L=l_{(k)})\n\\sum_{c}\ny_{(c)}\\cdot{\\mathbb{P}}(Y=y_{(c)}\\mid A=a,L=l_{(k)}, S=1)\\\\\n&=\n\\sum_{k}\n{\\mathbb{P}}(L=l_{(k)})\n\\mathbb{E}(Y\\mid A=a,L, S=1)\\\\\n&=\n\\mathbb{E}_L\n\\mathbb{E}(Y\\mid A=a,L, S=1) =\\mathbb{E}[Y\\mid do(A=a)]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis is, the IPW estimator converges to the true counterfactual mean given by intervention \\(do(A=a)\\). The last equality comes from two facts:\n\n\\(L\\) blocks all backdoor paths from \\(A\\) to \\(Y\\) when conditioning on \\(S=1\\)\n\\(\\mathbb{P}(L=l_{(k)})\\) is the population-distribution of \\(L\\), not the sample-based"

    "text": "Case 2: Selection does depend on a mediator\nThis case is equivalent to setting \\(\\gamma_2\\neq 0\\) in the SCM. To analyse this case let us leverage the accumulated knowledge for the previous case, in combination with the particularities of the new case:\n\nRegression-based approach\nA regression-based approach using only the selected samples would not work, because:\n\nAs before, conditioning on \\(S\\) opens some backdoor paths between treatment and outcome that could be blocked by \\(L\\), but its distribution differs in the sample from the population.\nA new backdoor path opens: \\(A\\longleftrightarrow u_s\\longleftrightarrow M\\longrightarrow Y\\), where \\(S\\) acts as a virtual collider. This path, however, cannot be blocked by any valid adjustment set. Trying to block it with \\(M\\) introduces bias by conditioning on a mediator.\n\n\n\nIPW-based approach\nHere is where our original analysis question pops up:\n\nIs the IPW estimator still consistent if the probability of selection depends on a mediator of the causal effect?\n\nConsider this:\n\nFor the IPW estimator being consistent the propensity score and the probability of selection must be jointly correctly specified. Since in our case the treatment assignment is randomized, the propensity score (either known or nonparametrically estimated with counts) is in fact correctly specified. This implies all responsibility for consistency lies on the model for the probability of selection.\nWe know that the probability of selection depends on \\(M\\), so for its model to be correctly specified it must use \\(M\\).\n\nThe question is then, will using \\(M\\) to model the probability of selection lead us to a consistent estimator for the ATE?\nWe will continue the analysis in another entry: part 2"
